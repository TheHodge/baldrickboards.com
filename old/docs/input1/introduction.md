# Introduction

The BaldrickInput1 is our way of making interactivity to a lightshow as easy as point and click rather than code and solder!

## Board Features

* Powerjack accepting 5v - 24v with onboard power management and able to accept individual voltages (to avoid any BOOM BOOM BOOM BOOMS)
* **1 Turniput** allowing full access to the Turnip Network controls and button lamp configuration.
* Small footprint for easy placement inside a project box
* Works over ethernet or Wifi (with antenna)
* Turniput allows effects via a button, motion sensor, reed switch, beam break or other input device.

This board is the perfect way to have a 'push for sound box' or push to 'start show box'
