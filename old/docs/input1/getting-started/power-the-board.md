# Powering the Board

The Input1 has a Barrel Jack for power and can handle 5v-24v, whatever you use for this will be used to power the LAMP so don't choose anything too large!

The Input1 is designed to use minimal power so it's possible to run it from a USB power bank if you wish to make something portable.
