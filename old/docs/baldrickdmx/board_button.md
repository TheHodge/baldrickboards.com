# Board Button

The BaldrickDMX comes with a button on the board.

This button is incase you break the board and need to reset it to factory settings. 

When held for 5 seconds **during the board boot process**, the controller will reset to factory settings, everything will be removed including the latest firmware and it will be the the 'shipping state' where you click to update to the latest firmware
