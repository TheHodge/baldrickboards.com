# Why the BaldrickDMX

There are many many options for running DMX as part of your light show, some are cheaper than the BaldrickDMX and some are much much more expensive!

Even before this board was launched we were compared to these options so we wrote some of our reasonings into an article

* The BaldrickDMX is listed as a controller in xLights and can be found using the discover mode, making it really easy to get started with sequencing with your show using the DMX model rather than as a pixel which can be a bit messy.  
* The BaldrickDMX is equipped with the three main DMX port types, meaning you don't need to spend money on a converter and you know you'll always have the right cable.
* The BaldrickDMX comes with presets and can be activated over the *Turnip Network* (i.e. via a button press)
* The BaldrickDMX has support for DDP
