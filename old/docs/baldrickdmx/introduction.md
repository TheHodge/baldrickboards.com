# Introduction

The BaldrickDMX is the perfect controller for adding DMX to your show.

## BaldrickDMX Controller Features

* 5v - 24v barrel or 2 pin connector with onboard power management (to avoid any BOOM BOOM BOOM BOOMS)
* Single output on 3 ports
    * RJ45
    * 3 Pin Neutrik XLR
    * 5 Pin Neutrik XLR
    
* DDP, Artnet, E1.31 & sACN compatible
* Button / Turnip activated presets 
* Small footprint compatible with other smart receiver mounts and Baldrick Boards
* Push from xLights integration

In addition, we've tried to add some simple quality of life improvements such as a QR code which links directly to the manual (easy to read on a mobile in the dark).


## Video introduction

The DMX board has been <strike>reques..</strike> demanded by some of our users since we announced we were doing additional boards after the Baldrick8 so we've put together a video to celebrate and introduce the board to the world.
