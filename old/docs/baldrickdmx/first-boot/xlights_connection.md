# xLights Connection
You can connect directly with xLights, look for BaldrickDMX under ilightthat

![xLights Download and Push](../img/xlights-settings.png)

From here you can push your model settings directly to the controller and output to lights nice and easily! 

You can either;
* Click **Discover** and xLights will automagically find the BaldrickDMX.
* Add the board manually by selecting *ILightThat* as a vendor and *BaldrickDMX* as the Model. You will then need to put the IP Address in manually
