# Plugging in your controller
The BaldrickDMX has a barrel jack connection and a 2 port phoenix connector, these can handle voltage from 5v to 24v, which should is to make it easier to match whatever you are plugging in.

For technical users - barrel connector (centre positive) and we use 5.5x2.1mm barrel jacks.

Please remember you are just powering the board not the devices so we don't a tonne of amps.

## Always use a power supply 

Never, ever EVER EVER plug your controller directly into the wall outlet, it will go bang and you'll have to buy another one and explain to your partner what that burn mark on the kitchen table is. 

You'll notice that a British plug has three wires and our power jacks inputs only have two that's because you need to put a power supply in between them.

We recommend the use of a [variable power supply](https://amzn.to/4c24ApH).
