# Badge Setup

When your badge is plugged into a power supply, it will create a wireless network which starts with *baldrickbadge-* it will then have an alphanumeric code on the back of it which matches the one on the sticker on the back of your badge.

The password is **hotplates**

For the event, we would recommend you do not join the WIFI network as that would give everyone else access to your badge.. and we wouldn't want people putting rude messages on them would we?
