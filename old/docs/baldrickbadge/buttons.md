# Buttons

We've added two buttons to the board for you to use, we've not quite worked out how to program them in the interface but these are the default responses

## Button One
* short press *turns LEDs on/off*
* long press *changes the palette colour (randomly?)*

## Button Two
* short press *cycles through effects (randomly?)*
* long press *adjusts the brightness (up one press, down the next)*
