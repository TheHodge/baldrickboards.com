# Connecting a Receiver

One of the questions that we often get (from the made up conversations we have with fake customers) is how do I expand the network with receivers.

*The simple answer is that you don't*

When designing the Baldrick8 a thought occured to us, a receiver requires a network connection and power, which is exactly what a Baldrick8 requires!

So rather than buy a receiver and have to deal with splitting down the maximum pixels allowed per port, you just buy another Baldrick8 and plug it into your network for the same price!
