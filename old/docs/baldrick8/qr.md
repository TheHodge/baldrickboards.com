# You've scanned the QR Code! 

### If you've not bought the board yet?
Then aren't you bloody nosey scanning random QR Codes, since you are here now you might as well buy a board from one of [our awesome vendors](where-to-buy.md)

### If you've not wired it up or turned it on yet?

If this is the first time you've looked at the board and want a hand setting it up, take a look at our [Getting Started Guide](/docs/category/first-boot)

### If it was working before but it isn't now and you promise it wasn't you that did it?


You might want to look at our  [Common Questions](/docs/category/first-boot) Section or how to [reset the board completely](board_buttons.md).

#### If everything is working fine and you had a spare minute and wanted to see where this QR code went?

TADA!
