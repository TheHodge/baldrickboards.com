# Introduction


## Baldrick8 Controller Features

* 2 ports accepting 5v - 24v with onboard power management and able to accept individual voltages (to avoid any BOOM BOOM BOOM BOOMS)
* 8 Ports handling many pixels per port (but 750 pixels per port at 40fps)
* 2 Power inputs (which combined with the included 7.5 amp fuses allows for full pixel runs at 100%)
* DDP, Artnet, E1.31 & sACN compatible
* 3 Programmable Button ports (Can use the FPP API to start / stop a sequence)
* Small footprint compatible with other smart receiver mounts
* No Pi or FPP Licence required
* Push from xLights integration

In addition, we've tried to add some simple quality of life improvements such as a QR code which links directly to the manual (easy to read on a mobile in the dark) and the three buttons have not only ports but physical buttons onboard to help you test without having to hook everything up.


## Video introduction

Our good friend Greg has produced a video overview of our 'development board' which you should have a watch over tonight whilst you're having dinner.

*Just a quick note that this unboxing is a development version of the board so things like E1.31 and other developments are coming to the board, they just weren't present in this release*
