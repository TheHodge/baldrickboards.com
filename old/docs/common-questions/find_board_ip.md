# baldrickboard.local not loading
We use something called mDNS to make the magical URL appear and respond, however this doesn't work for every operating system *(it also doesn't work for those lucky people who have more than one Baldrick Board)*. 

You'll notice that when you look at the Baldrick Board, there isn't a screen! That's because we used all the ports for pixels, so you will need to find the I.P. Address of the board yourself, luckily this isn't too difficult.

## Windows

if you have xLights installed then you can use the included xScanner to look at all the devices on your network, it can be a large list that's a little overwhelming but you are looking for a device called BaldrickBoard (or Baldrick8).

## Mac

We recommend the Free Mac App [IP Scanner](https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/ip-scanner/id6443819966) which will search up to 25 devices on your network for free, plenty for most households.

## Linux

If you are using Linux and you need a help document written in a sarcastic tone to tell you how to find the I.P. address of a device added to your network, can we recommend you follow [this tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAOO8pr5LRE)
