# Stats

![BaldrickSignals Web Interface Stats ](../img/web-interface-stats.png)

The Stats board gives you a heads up as to what's going on with your controller

#### Uptime 
Tells you how long your controller has been powered on *(this is useful in June to remind you that you forgot to turn it off over christmas)*

#### Temperature 
With a sensor next to the Ethernet connector, this gives you an indication of the board temperature *(in Celsius) because water freezes at 0, not 32.. how does that make sense?*

Generally, PCBs and components are good for -40 to +85°C, Anything below 60°C on this board is fine and nothing to worry about. If the temp is above that, try blowing on it like you would a hot chip out of the oven. 

#### Firmware Version 
This will let you know your current version and if there is a version to upgrade to. 

*(clicking the new version will upgrade it in place then restart the controller)*

#### IP Address 
It would be pretty silly to have a controller information box without showing you the IP Address of the controller wouldn't it? That would be like launching a controller without being able to manage the networking.
