# Introduction

The BaldrickSignals is the easy to use board to monitor your display popularity, using outputting device signals *(and a configurable modifier)* you can estimate your crowd numbers & see your popular times to plan accordingly.

## BaldrickSignals Controller Features

* Barrel Powerjack accepting 5v - 24v with onboard power management and able to accept individual voltages (to avoid any BOOM BOOM BOOM BOOMS)
* Small footprint for easy placement inside a project box
* Turnip Network Integration to allow actions based on crowd sizes (e.g adjusting volume or highlighting donation areas) **Coming Soon**
* Simple UI with CSV download and Google docs integration

In addition, we've tried to add some simple quality of life improvements such as a QR code which links directly to the manual (easy to read on a mobile in the dark).
