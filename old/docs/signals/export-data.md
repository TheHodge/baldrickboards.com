# Exporting the Data

By adding your /csv to the I.P. Address of your signals board, you'll get a lovely CSV of all the historical data we've got. 

We've got a Google Sheet that you can use to visualise this data and translate it

If you head to (https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1HxzmnijoHGhpXuaj56Qjr46F0nn8GIqbdiMp5Fp0N6U/edit?usp=sharing)[https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1HxzmnijoHGhpXuaj56Qjr46F0nn8GIqbdiMp5Fp0N6U/edit?usp=sharing]

then go to File and Make a copy

You can then delete the information in the first two columns and paste the results of your CSV page.

The Graph page will now show you a pretty graph of your signals
