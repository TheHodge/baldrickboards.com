# 3. xLights

Typically light shows in this hobby use some free open source software called [xLights](https://www.xlights.org).

You can download xLights and create your whole show on your computer without buying a single thing.





A general display consists of two elements, the Layout and the sequence, with the effort required for both of these they could almost be considered two separate hobbies in themselves. 

## Layout 
The layout and building of your lights is what most would consider the ‘bulk’ of the work, depending on the level of complexity.

Stand where your audience will stand and take a photo of where the display will be, then you can import that into your light display software and start placing where the lights will be.

Lights are generally grouped into lines, props and trees;
 
Lines can be put around the house and windows for a fantastic effect 
Props shapes that are generally made of correx and lights are pushed through to give a certain shape such as a star, bulb, tree or  arches
Trees are a group of lines with a star on top, depending on the amount of lines and lights with enough lights and lines, you’ve got yourself a MEGA TREE  

Once you’ve decided on your layout, it’s time to start ordering and building!


## Sequencing

A sequence is the thing that makes the lights do pretty colours! A sequence ranges from some nice simple effects that just change the colours to fully time coded shows with music, singing elements and DMX fun stuff. 

Before you get too excited / overwhelmed once again, the vast majority of people who see your show will be impressed at the simplest effect.

Many people in the hobby do no sequencing at all, they [buy sequences](https://www.xtremesequences.com) (or use free ones) and map them onto their own layout,  never feel that there is something wrong with this, it takes a certain type of person to be able to sequence well and also, a lot of people simply don’t enjoy it.

Even if you are using other peoples sequences, it’s important to understand the basics of sequencing and how things work and can be configured (no sequence is going to map perfectly into your layout without some poking and tweaking)
