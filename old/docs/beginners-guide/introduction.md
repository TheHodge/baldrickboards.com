# 1. Introduction

**THIS GUIDE IS A WORK IN PROGRESS**

This guide is design to be a quick introduction to the hobby of seasonal syncronised lighting, it is designed for two categories of people

* Someone who excitedly bought a Baldrick board and now wonders *what the hell do I do with it*
* Someone who has seen a show in person (or a viral youtube video) and thought *I'd like to do that*

Syncronised lighting is a one of the best hobbies you can have, it can bring your community together, raise money for good causes and teach you some new skills

**However**, it's not a quick hobby, many people in the community will work on their show throughout the year, if you are reading this in October or November, I'd *HIGHLY* recommend looking at getting this bits of a show NEXT YEAR, unless you've got 8 weeks off work and don't mind watching a lot of videos!

This is a quick start guide, not a fully in-depth manual for every setting of every section, there are thousands of youtube videos, facebook posts and online forum posts. The ILightThat team is unable to help with specific show questions (should I use x or y in my show).

We list some of the resources you should use on our next steps page and we recommend you join and become part of your local lighting community (rather than just post HELP when the show doesn't turn on).
