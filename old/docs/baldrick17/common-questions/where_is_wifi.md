# Where is the WIFI?
You see the ESP32 chip and instantly think WIFI enabled, however at the moment, after testing latency and throughput over WIFI, we are focusing on the Ethernet connection at this time. 

The Baldrick8 has been designed for 750 pixels per port @ 40FPS and with WIFI we are unable to get close to that. 

That's not to say we will never support it, just don't buy this board for the WIFI support.

*If WIFI is a MUST HAVE then one option some of our users are using is via FPP proxy*
