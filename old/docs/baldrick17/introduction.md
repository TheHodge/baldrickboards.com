# Introduction

The Baldrick17 is a newest Pixel controller to join the Baldrick Family.

## Baldrick17 Controller Features

* 5 ports accepting 5v - 48v with onboard power management and able to accept individual voltages (to avoid any BOOM BOOM BOOM BOOMS)
    * Power ports are banked (4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1)
* 17 Ports handling up to 750 pixels per port at 40fps
* 17 fused connectors which combined with the included 7.5 amp fuses allows for full pixel runs at 100%
* DDP, Artnet, E1.31 & sACN compatible
* 3 Programmable Turniputs ports (Can use the FPP API to start / stop a sequence and full lamp control)
* No Pi or FPP Licence required
* Push from xLights integration

In addition, we've tried to add some simple quality of life improvements such as a QR code which links directly to the manual (easy to read on a mobile in the dark) and the three buttons have not only ports but physical buttons onboard to help you test without having to hook everything up.
