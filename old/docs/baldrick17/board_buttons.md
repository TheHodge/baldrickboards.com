# Board Buttons

The Baldrick comes with three ports to attach external inputs to, when tiggers these can do anything from change the song in FPP to activate a snow machine, you can read about how in the [web interface](web-interface/buttons.md) second.

The board has three physical buttons on which simulate each of the desired functionality. 

Button 3 has special functionality to help you when you've broken it and want to start again

## Button 1
When held for 5 seconds, the controller will enable [Hodgical Mode](../common-questions/hodgical-test-mode) this can be disabled in the web UI'


## Button 2
When held for 5 seconds **during the board boot process**, the controller will reset all network settings assigned to this board, so if you've mixed up your DHCP, IP and AOLICQ then this is how you fix it before anyone realizes what you've done.


## Button 3 
When held for 5 seconds **during the board boot process**, the controller will reset to factory settings, everything will be removed including the latest firmware and it will be the the 'shipping state' where you click to update to the latest firmware
