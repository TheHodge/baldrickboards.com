# Turniput

The Input8 has eight of the incredible the **Turniput**.

The **Turniput** brings the full power of the *Turnip Network* to your lightshow.

Using the powerful web interface you can build interactions with limitless possibility.

* Start a Sequence / Playlist in FPP (either specific or random)
* Turn the FPP volume on for a set period of time
* Engage a [BaldrickDMX](baldrickdmx/introduction) preset
* Turn on / off a [BaldrickSwitchy](switchy/introduction) port
* Activate *A specific test mode* on a [Baldrick8](baldrick8/introduction)
* Run a more advanced FPP command
* Send a webhook request

The Turniput is designed not only to be used with Buttons but anything that can complete a circuit.

* Beam Break
* Reed Switch
* Motion Sensor
* Distance Sensor
* Sound Sensor

If you are using the Turniput with a button that has an LED in it our lamp controls allow you to enable the status of the LED depending on the Turniput status - On, Off or Breath.

A Turniput has two states, press and hold. Both can be configured to do different things and after each state you can enable a timeout for x seconds.
