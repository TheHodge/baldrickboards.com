# Introduction

The Baldrick family of boards have been designed to fill gaps in the market that we've seen. 

They won't have every feature of some of the more mainstream boards but that doesn't mean we don't have a few tricks up our sleeve.

This manual is designed to answer questions and get you started on the journey, it's written to be user friendly (and sometimes funny).

If you've bought a Baldrick controller and have no idea what to do with it then take a look at our beginners guide.

If you are looking for the dimensions of the boards or some STLS to print mounts we've got them.

We've got a section about each board which contains screenshots, common questions and issues people have come across (we also link to our vendor partners who sell them).

This is a living website, it gets several updates a week depending on how much Red Bull Dom has drunk that week so always try and check the doc before asking questions in the community.
