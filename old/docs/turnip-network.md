# The Turnip Network

The Baldrick family of boards have developed with *ease of use* as one of the core principles, this lead the creation of '**The Turnip Network**

The BaldrickBoards will find each other on the network, allowing you to easily switch between them when doing configuration.

Test Sync allows you to enable test mode on one Baldrick Mode and all the others in that series will follow (so when you turn Hodgical Model Mode on one Baldrick8, it will turn on the rest of them)

Some of the Baldrick boards have buttons (or Turniputs) and these allow integration with not only all the other boards in the family, but also FPP and web hooks!.

It's what those people in business suits call '*synergy*'
