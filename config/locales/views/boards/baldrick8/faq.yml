                answer: |
                  <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">Hodgical Mode is our special test mode that adds a bit of fun to testing your pixels.</p>
                  <p class="text-gray-700">It's named after one of our team members who has a particular sense of humor about these things.</p>

                question: "Where is the WiFi?"

                answer: |
                  <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">You see the ESP32 chip and instantly think WIFI enabled, however at the moment, after testing latency and throughput over WIFI, we are focusing on the Ethernet connection at this time.</p>
                  <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">The Baldrick8 has been designed for 750 pixels per port @ 40FPS and with WIFI we are unable to get close to that.</p>
                  <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">That's not to say we will never support it, just don't buy this board for the WIFI support.</p>
                  <p class="text-gray-700"><em>If WIFI is a MUST HAVE then one option some of our users are using is via FPP proxy</em></p>

                question: "How do FPP API Commands work?"

                  - "baldrick8/fpp-playlist-volume.png"
                answer: |
                  <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">FPP comes with a really useful API which lets us do things like play sequences, change the volume and more remotely.</p>
                  <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">Combining that API with the Baldrick button URL boxes is a simple way of adding interactive elements to your show.</p>
                  <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">The first thing we need is the IP Address of your FPP installation, in this case we are using <strong>192.168.1.50</strong> but please replace this when adding to your button config.</p>
                  <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">Commands are sent to the URL <strong>/api/command/command name/options</strong></p>
                  <h4 class="text-lg font-semibold text-gray-900 mb-3">Start the show</h4>
                  <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">If you want to give someone a magical moment and be able to start the show by pressing a button, you must first get your show playlist name (in this case we are using <strong>Show Time</strong> as our playlist name but please replace it with yours)</p>
                  <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">You set your button command to go to</p>
                  <div class="bg-gray-100 rounded-lg p-4 mb-4">
                    <code class="text-sm">e.g. http://192.168.1.50/api/command/Start Playlist/Show Time</code>
                  </div>
                  <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">This will start the playlist everytime someone presses the button, which is great.. until some little sh... visitor presses it again and again, to solve that we can use the <strong>IfNotRunning</strong> setting.</p>
                  <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">Add <strong>/false/true</strong> to the end of that URL <em>(The false tells FPP not to repeat the playlist and the true tells it only to play if it isn't already playing)</em></p>
                  <div class="bg-gray-100 rounded-lg p-4 mb-4">
                    <code class="text-sm">e.g. http://192.168.1.50/api/command/Start Playlist/Show Time/false/true</code>
                  </div>
                  <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4"><em>Warning, if another playlist is playing whilst this button is pressed, it will interupt it</em></p>
                  <h4 class="text-lg font-semibold text-gray-900 mb-3">Sound on button</h4>
                  <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">Lets say that you wanted to only play the sound on your show when someone presses a button and that continues till either the end of the song or playlist.</p>
                  <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">You set your button command to go to</p>
                  <div class="bg-gray-100 rounded-lg p-4 mb-4">
                    <code class="text-sm">e.g. http://192.168.1.50/api/command/Volume Set/70</code>
                  </div>
                  <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">Then at the bottom of each playlist (or song in the playlist) you just add an entry for FPP command which sets the volume to 0</p>

                answer: |
                  <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">Some of batches of 4 wire pixels (double data) require a constant source of data, otherwise some genius thought it would be a great idea to have the default to a test mode on full 100% brightness..</p>
                  <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">The most common of these are GS8208 pixels.</p>
                  <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">You can set your Baldrick8 to the Paint it Black test mode which will stop that but its a pain in the arse to change everytime you stop your show.</p>
                  <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">For those using FPP you can configure FPP to output channel data at all times.</p>
                  <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">Firstly you need to enable the Advanced UI by going to Settings > UI > Interface level and switching that to Advanced.</p>
                  <div class="bg-gray-100 rounded-lg p-4 mb-4">
                    <img src="%{image_1}" class="w-full rounded mb-4" alt="FPP Advanced mode">
                  </div>
                  <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">Then head to the Input / Output tab and tick the box which states "Always Transmit Channel Data"</p>
                  <div class="bg-gray-100 rounded-lg p-4 mb-4">
                    <img src="%{image_2}" class="w-full rounded mb-4" alt="FPP Constantly Transmit">
                  </div>
                  <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">This means FPP will keep outputting data to the pixels even if there isn't a sequence playing.</p>
                  <p class="text-gray-700"><em>As of writing we are currently in a seasonal feature freeze for the Baldrick family which means no new updates will be posted unless they are firmware breaking, however we will review how we can work on this on a controller level once this is over</em></p>

                question: "Is This Just WLED?"
                images: []
                answer: |
                  <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">We've had a lot of questions <em>(3)</em> asking just how we've got 750 pixels at 40FPS on WLED and the honest answer is that <strong>we don't.</strong></p>
                  <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">We <em>love</em> WLED and use it in our other projects, early versions of the Baldrick used it as well however we realised that there was a <em>lot</em> of functionality in WLED that we were never going to use and those functions take RAM and storage.</p>
                  <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">With that in mind we made the decision to write our own firmware with three principles in mind;</p>
                  <ul class="list-disc list-inside text-gray-700 mb-4">
                    <li>A minimum 600 Pixels per port at 40FPS <em>(which actually ended up being 750 per port!)</em></li>
                    <li>A really simple (& Fun) UI</li>
                    <li>Focused core features dedicated to Seasonal Lighting</li>
                  </ul>
                  <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">Whilst it's true that the Baldrick8 doesn't have every feature of some of the other boards, or the WLED software.</p>

                answer: |
                  <p class="text-gray-700">The xTreme Edition is a version of the board that is sold by <a href="https://xtremesequences.com" class="text-blue-600 hover:text-blue-800" target="_blank">xTreme Sequences</a> exclusively for their members, in Ron Howards mind it is the greatest edition ever made and no other edition comes close however in reality it is NO DIFFERENT from the other boards apart from the name and logo.</p>

                question: "How do I connect a receiver?"
                images: []
                answer: |
                  <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">One of the questions that we often get (from the made up conversations we have with fake customers) is how do I expand the network with receivers?</p>
                  <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4"><strong>The simple answer is that you don't</strong></p>
                  <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">When designing the Baldrick8 a thought occured to us, a receiver requires a network connection and power, which is exactly what a Baldrick8 requires!</p>
                  <p class="text-gray-700">So rather than buy a receiver and have to deal with splitting down the maximum pixels allowed per port, you just buy another Baldrick8 and plug it into your network for the same price!</p>
