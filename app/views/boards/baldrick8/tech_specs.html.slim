                strong Power Jack - 
                | Both 1 & 2 are power input jacks, these can take 5v to 24v (each side can take different voltages) and will automatically step down to power the components, no jumpers needed.
              li
                strong Pixel connectors - 
                | Using the industry standard Phoenix connectors, your pigtails or extensions will be added in G (Ground) D (Data) + (Positive / Voltage)
              li
                strong Fuse Holder - 
                | Easy to access fuses for protection (and easy changing).
              li
                strong Ethernet port - 
                | To ensure the high FPS that this controller is designed for we've added a 100mb ethernet port to connect to your show network
              li
                strong QR Code - 
                | An easy to scan QR code which will take you to these docs for easy troubleshooting
              li
                strong Button connectors - 
                | The Baldrick8 can run three buttons which will execute URLS on press (we also have physical buttons on the board for testing, pressing and holding these buttons will activate test mode or reset the board)
              li
                strong Mounting Holes - 
                | We've designed the Baldrick8 to not only be as compact as possible, we've matched the mounting holes to other common controllers so mounts can be reused (in this case the Falcon SRX2 Receiver).
