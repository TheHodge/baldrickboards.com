          p.text-lg.text-gray-700.mb-8
            | Baldrick is more than just a name - it's a philosophy. We believe that the best technology should be as cunning as a fox who's just been appointed Professor of Cunning at Oxford University.

                  strong Our Mission:
                  |  To create controller boards that are not just functional, but delightfully clever and surprisingly powerful.

          / The Name Section
          h3.text-2xl.font-bold.text-gray-900.mb-4 The Name
          
          p.text-gray-700.mb-6
            | The name "Baldrick" comes from the cunning character in the classic British comedy "Blackadder." Just like our namesake, our boards are designed to be clever, resourceful, and surprisingly effective despite their humble appearance.

          p.text-gray-700.mb-6
            | When you choose a Baldrick board, you're not just getting a controller - you're getting a piece of technology that thinks outside the box, finds clever solutions to complex problems, and does it all with a touch of British wit.
