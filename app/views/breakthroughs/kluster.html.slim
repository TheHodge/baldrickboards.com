            | The Kluster is our state-of-the-art development and testing system where we design, prototype, and validate all Baldrick products before they reach our customers. But it didn't start that way - it began with a customer's problem and some old plywood.

          p.text-gray-700.mb-4
            | The story of The Kluster begins with one of our customers who was having issues with 15

            |  on a large mega tree. When Dom heard about the problem, he knew he needed a way to replicate and test the setup to understand what was going wrong.
          p.text-gray-700.mb-6
            | So Dom took some old plywood he had received, cut up a load of positive and negative cables, found 24 Baldrick boards and added a pixel to each. This simple setup became the foundation of what we now call The Kluster.

          p.text-gray-700.mb-4
            | After fixing some pixel issues, we then expanded The Kluster to have a monitoring system called Edmund which monitors all development data from the boards and allows us to test new features for issues.
          p.text-gray-700.mb-4
            | Being a remote team, we wanted the ability to press buttons and turn off boards without someone physically present, so The Kluster and Edmund were expanded to manage relays and have an API for end-to-end testing.
          p.text-gray-700.mb-6
            | Today, Edmund and The Kluster now do pixel color monitoring, allowing us to track and analyze the performance of individual pixels across all our test boards in real-time.

            | The Kluster now has instances of every board and revision in the Baldrick family (and a few not yet released) and is still under continuous development. We've recently upgraded Dom's old plywood for some good-looking laser cut mounts and we've got some custom PCBs on the way to help us monitor a bit more.
