Luckily our good friend Greg Macaree has written a guide on how to still get updates during this method and we've shamelessly stolen it. First up, we need to ensure your UI is set to advanced. Then under Network Configuration (eth0) give it a static IP outside your regular range and setting the Gateway and DNS as your regular WiFi router. I set IP Forwarding to Masquerading/NAT and enabled DHCP server: And then on Network Settings (wlan0) I left it on DHCP, but ensured the DNS remained on manual with the settings as above. I set IP Forwarding as Masquerading/NAT once again. Once completed, I save & reboot the Pi. Having rebooted (mine didn't come back the first time and I had to power cycle it). I then plugged Baldrick into it & powered it on. A few moments later, I checked the Network Settings / Eth0 and It has seen the Baldrick and assigned an IP address to it. I could then check the Enable box to set a DHCP reservation (so it doesn't move IP's). With that active, I could then go to Status/Control, Proxy Settings and under DHCP hosts was an entry for the Baldrick: Click that link and up comes the Baldrick webpage. That is telling me that v2.5 is available, so that shows it has internet connectivity. Job done. Now you can set it up in xLights, with the IP listed above (10.0.0.4 in my case) and the proxy being the Pi's Wifi IP (in my case 192.168.1.57)","category":"faq","tags":["main","faq"],"excerpt":"Upgrading Baldrick via FPP Proxy Some of you like to make things complicated and run FPP through tethering or proxy mode!

Finally, a question we actually get a fair amount! During our prototyping phase we realised that adding an LCD to the boards not only added additional cost, it also reduced functionality as the the screen (and buttons if any) would require more ports and well, we want to use them for core functionaility. Generally, you only need a screen when setting up the board to work out what IP address it is. Instead of a screen we've implemented some quality of life features to make that better. The board will respond to baldrickboard.local in most cases The board will detect other boards on the network and allow you to find out their name, details and sync test mode. If those fail, we have a nice Guide on finding the IP to help you out. So no screens ever?

The BaldrickSwitchy has been designed to be as flexible as possible with regards to the types of things it can power which means that you can even put mains electricity through the relay connectors (NOT THE BARREL CONNECTOR), which if touched could cause issues. Every BaldrickSwitchy sold comes with a DarwinTray to help protect you from accidentally winning a Darwin award. The DarwinTray reduces the risk (but doesn't guarantee!) of you making from any contact with anything that could be live whilst still making it easy to mount to your box.","category":"BaldrickSwitchy FAQ","tags":["baldrickswitchy","faq"],"excerpt":"What is this tray?
